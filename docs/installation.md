# Installation

You can install `jupyterlite-xeus-python` with `pip`:

```
pip install jupyterlite-xeus-python
```

Once you have installed `jupyterlite-xeus-python`, you can use it as a kernel in JupyterLite. You can use the `jupyter lite` command line interface to build a JupyterLite application to start using the `xeus-python` kernel:

```bash
jupyter lite build
```
